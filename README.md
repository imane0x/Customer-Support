# Customer Support LLM with SQL Database Integration

This project utilizes a fine-tuned [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) model to manage customer support queries, integrated with an SQL database for order management. The system allows responding to queries, checking order statuses, updating shipment information, and retrieving user order histories.

## Features

- **Fine-tuned LLM**: The model has been fine-tuned using a [customer support dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kaludi/Customer-Support-Responses) to ensure it handles customer interactions effectively.
  
- **Order Management**: SQL integration provides the capability to fetch and update order information from the database, enabling real-time order status tracking, shipment updates, and customer history retrieval.
